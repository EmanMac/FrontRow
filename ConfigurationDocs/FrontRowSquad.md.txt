This is following the instructions on
 https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-configure-prosody-xmpp-server-ubuntu-16-04-17-04

sudo systemnctl start prosody -starts the service
sudo systemctl stop prosody. - stops service. 
sydo systemctl enable prosody -enables at boot. 
sudo systemctl disable prosody -disables auto boot.

I did not mess with the modules enabled. 

I have the ssl set to localhost. when I did a sudo ls -l
on the srever it looked like a symbolic link pointed to 
another file so I assume that one works. My guess is that 
another team got it working and a symbolic link was created. 


I set c2s_requre_encryption and s2s_secure_auth to true,
to enforce client to server and server to server encryption. 

I am skipping the BOSH steps for now.

I set up two admins so far inside the cfg file. 
emanmac@sootsplash.csci2461.com
mannd00@sootsplash.csci2461.com

Skipping the allowing for registration from XMPP segment for now.

Under the virtual host I changed the host from just csci2461.com to sootsplash.csci2461.com
also changed the ssl key from /etc/prosody/certs/example.com.key
to /etc/prosody/certs/localhost.key
and the cert from /etc/prosody/certs/example.com.crt
to /etc/prosody/certs/localhost.crt

ran sudo luac -p /etc/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua
No error messages popped up so I assume nothing is wrong so far.
A quick online search tells me no messages are displayed if the files passes the integrity test.

restarted the service
sudo systemctl restart prosody

Creating users
I tried to create a user with 
sudo prosodyctl adduser emanmac@chat.sootsplash.csci2461.com
"The host chat.sootsplash.csci2461.com' is not listed in the configuration file, the user will not be able to log in until this is changed. 
I changed the virtualhost to chat.sootsplash...
